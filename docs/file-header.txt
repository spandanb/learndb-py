This outlines the file header for the learndb file.

The file header is motivated by how free pages are managed. When a node is removed from a btree, the underlying page
is returned to the pager to be recycled. The pager can reprovision these page numbers, but once the virtual machine is
shutdown (and the pager recycled) - the page number information is lost, and space is lost.

To avoid this leak, the interspersed pages, are kept in a single linked list, with the head of the list stored in the
file header. The other way to avoid this is to compact the file each time it is closed. But this has it's own concerns, i.e.
performance impact of compaction.

The file header, will also store a version number.

 file header -> version_string next_free_page
 version_string  -> "learndb v<majorVar>.<minorVar>.<bugfix>"
 next_free_page -> int, next page_num

Non-root free pages will only have the first word byte corresponding to the next free page.
A null value in the linked list is specified with an offset of 0.
