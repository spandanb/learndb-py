I want to explicate the file format details for learndb. It's similar to sqlite but with many simplifications.

The current internal nodes may need to have their keys changed

Leaf nodes will be formatted like:

- (low address) header, cell pointer array, unallocated space, cells (high address)
- cell ptrs are sorted by key (2 bytes); contain page offset to cell
- cell -> [key_size, data_size, payload (key, data)]
    -- data can be divided into header and body
    -- data header -> [size of header, serial types (size of variable length value)?
    -- data body -> concatenated bytes of serialized values (in definition order)
    -- all data must fit in a cell, i.e. no overflow- this limits the max content size to what can fit in a single cell

serial types:
    sqlite for inspiration (https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat2.html#record_format)

        serial-type  byte-length  datatype
        0            0            Null
        1            4            Integer
        2            4            Float
        3            var          Text
        4            var          Blob

    Types with a fixed-value, e.g. null will not be encoded in the data payload.
