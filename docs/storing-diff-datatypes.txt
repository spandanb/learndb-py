how does a record get stored?
If I want to support nulls and variable length strings, seems like I'll need to store something like
the schema in the cells themselves.

sqlite handles this via Record Format.
Basically, the record, i.e. body of a leaf entry, has a header and a body.
the header is like:
- size of header (4b)
- one int per column (called serial types)-
    - the serial type encodes the datatype
    e.g.
    serial-type  byte-length  datatype
    0            0            Null
    1            4            Integer
    2            4            Float
    2            var          Text
    3            var          Blob

I'll also need to encode length for variable types. This could be a set of ints after the serial types, one for
each variable length value, e.g.

[size of header, serial types, integer length of each value that is variable encoded]

Thus, since we have to store record details- I should also rethink what's the best place to handle serde.
